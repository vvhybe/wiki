## Setup To-Do List

### 1. NixOS Installation and Basic Configuration
- [ ] **Install NixOS**  
  Follow the official [NixOS installation guide](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/#sec-installation).
- [ ] **Configure `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`**  
    - [ ] Enable basic services (network, firewall, etc.)
    - [ ] Set up user accounts and permissions.
    - [ ] Configure system options (time zone, locale, etc.)
- [ ] **Rebuild and switch to the new configuration:**  
```bash
  sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

2. Terminal (ghostty)

- [ ] Installation

Install ghostty using a Nix package if available or via a custom build.


- [ ] Configuration

Set color schemes and use Cascadia Cove as the font.

Create custom profiles as needed.


3. Window Manager (Hyperland)

- [ ] Installation

Add Hyperland to your NixOS configuration.


- [ ] Configuration

Define keybindings, layouts, and other settings.

Integrate with the session manager to start Hyperland automatically.



4. Shell (nushell)

- [ ] Installation

Install nushell via the Nix package manager.


- [ ] Configuration

Edit the nushell configuration file (typically config.nu).

Set nushell as the default shell for your user.



5. Development Tools

- [ ] Node.js

Install via the Nix package (nodejs).


- [ ] Docker

Install Docker and add your user to the Docker group.

Test Docker installation with a simple container run.



6. Utility Tools

- [ ] bat: Install for enhanced file viewing with syntax highlighting.

- [ ] eza: Replace traditional ls with eza for a modern file listing.

- [ ] broot: Install for efficient filesystem navigation.

- [ ] btop: Install for system resource monitoring.

- [ ] zoxide: Install for faster directory jumping.

- [ ] yazi & rager: Verify if these tools meet your workflow needs; configure as required.

- [ ] rofi: Set up as the application launcher.

- [ ] dunst: Configure dunst for managing desktop notifications.


7. Git Utilities

- [ ] lazygit: Install for a terminal-based git interface.

- [ ] lazydocker: Install for managing Docker containers in a terminal UI.


8. Editor (Neovim with NVChad)

- [ ] Neovim:

Install Neovim using Nix.


- [ ] NVChad:

Clone and configure NVChad as your Neovim configuration.


- [ ] Plugin & LSP Setup:

Set up language servers, plugins, and additional configurations to suit your development needs.



9. Optional Enhancements

- [ ] Pomodoro Timer:

Install a Pomodoro timer such as Pomotroid for productivity.


[ ] Status Bar (Optional):

Consider a minimal status bar (e.g., Polybar) if you want extra visual feedback.


[ ] Dotfiles Management:

Create a Git repository for all your configuration files to track changes and simplify migrations.


[ ] System Backup:

Regularly backup your configuration files and custom scripts.

Configuration Suggestions and Enhancements

Leverage NixOS Declarative Configurations:
Use NixOS modules and overlays to manage your packages and configurations reproducibly.

Version Control Your Setup:
Keep your /etc/nixos/ configuration under version control (e.g., Git) to easily track and revert changes.

Modular Configurations:
Break your configuration into modular files (e.g., separate files for WM, shell, tools) and import them in your main configuration.nix.

Documentation:
Document any custom scripts, tweaks, or unusual configurations within this Obsidian note or a separate documentation file.

Regular Updates:
Schedule periodic reviews of your configuration to incorporate updates, new tools, or remove unused components.

Additional Tools:
Consider lightweight alternatives if you find any of the tools resource-heavy or too complex. For example, if a simpler terminal or shell could improve your workflow, donâ€™t hesitate to experiment.

Final Notes

Testing:
After setting up each component, test its functionality individually to ensure system stability.

Logging and Troubleshooting:
Regularly check system logs and monitor performance to quickly catch any misconfigurations.

Iterative Improvements:
This setup is a starting point. Adjust and expand your configurations as your workflow evolves.
